Feature: Set cart rule product restrictions in BO
  PrestaShop allows BO users to add and remove product restrictions of cart rule,
  Product restrictions are a rulesets that defines what & how many products must be in a cart for cart rule to take effect.
  As a BO user I must be able to edit cart rules products restrictions

  Background:

    And there is a currency named "chf" with iso code "CHF" and exchange rate of 1.25
    And currency "usd" is the default one

  # @todo: create cart rules once in first scenario, so they are not recreated before every scenario.
  #  This step is temporary and should be replaced by step "Given there is a cart rule..." in backhround
  #  when following PR is merged: https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32483
  Scenario: Create cart rules for further steps
    And I create cart rule "rule_free_shipping_1" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]       | free shipping 1      |
      | is_active         | true                 |
      | allow_partial_use | false                |
      | priority          | 1                    |
      | valid_from        | 2022-01-01 11:00:00  |
      | valid_to          | 3001-01-01 12:00:00  |
      | total_quantity    | 10                   |
      | quantity_per_user | 10                   |
      | free_shipping     | true                 |
      | code              | rule_free_shipping_1 |
    And I create cart rule "rule_50_percent" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]                            | Half the price         |
      | is_active                              | true                   |
      | allow_partial_use                      | true                   |
      | priority                               | 2                      |
      | valid_from                             | 2022-01-01 11:00:00    |
      | valid_to                               | 3001-01-01 12:00:00    |
      | total_quantity                         | 10                     |
      | quantity_per_user                      | 12                     |
      | free_shipping                          | false                  |
      | code                                   | rule_50_percent        |
      | reduction_percentage                   | 50                     |
      | reduction_apply_to_discounted_products | false                  |
      | discount_application_type              | order_without_shipping |
    And cart rule "rule_free_shipping_1" should have no product restriction rules
    And cart rule "rule_50_percent" should have no product restriction rules

  Scenario: Restrict cart rule products and clear all the restrictions
    When I add a restriction for cart rule rule_free_shipping_1, which requires at least 5 products in cart matching one of these rules:
      | type     | references        |
      | products | product1,product2 |
    And I add a restriction for cart rule rule_free_shipping_1, which requires at least 1 product in cart matching one of these rules:
      | type     | references |
      | products | product1   |
      | products | product2   |
      | products | product3   |
    And I save product restrictions for cart rule rule_free_shipping_1
    Then cart rule "rule_free_shipping_1" should have the following product restriction rule groups:
      | groupReference | quantity | rules count |
      | group_nr_1     | 5        | 1           |
      | group_nr_2     | 1        | 3           |
    And the cart rule restriction group "group_nr_1" should have the following rules:
      | type     | references        |
      | products | product1,product2 |
    And the cart rule restriction group "group_nr_2" should have the following rules:
      | type     | references |
      | products | product1   |
      | products | product2   |
      | products | product3   |
    And cart rule "rule_50_percent" should have no product restriction rules
    When I clear all product restrictions for cart rule rule_free_shipping_1
    Then cart rule "rule_free_shipping_1" should have no product restriction rules

  Scenario: Restrict cart rule products by defining attribute matching rules
    When I add a restriction for cart rule rule_50_percent, which requires at least 7 products in cart matching one of these rules:
      | type       | references |
      | attributes | S,M        |
    And I add a restriction for cart rule rule_50_percent, which requires at least 2 product in cart matching one of these rules:
      | type       | references |
      | attributes | S,M        |
      | attributes | L          |
    And I save product restrictions for cart rule rule_50_percent
    Then cart rule "rule_50_percent" should have the following product restriction rule groups:
      | groupReference | quantity | rules count |
      | group_nr_1     | 7        | 1           |
      | group_nr_2     | 2        | 2           |
    And the cart rule restriction group "group_nr_1" should have the following rules:
      | type       | references |
      | attributes | S,M        |
    And the cart rule restriction group "group_nr_2" should have the following rules:
      | type       | references |
      | attributes | S,M        |
      | attributes | L          |
    And cart rule "rule_free_shipping_1" should have no product restriction rules

  Scenario: Restrict cart rule products by defining category matching rules
    When I add a restriction for cart rule rule_50_percent, which requires at least 3 products in cart matching one of these rules:
      | type       | references |
      | categories | home       |
    And I add a restriction for cart rule rule_50_percent, which requires at least 2 product in cart matching one of these rules:
      | type       | references  |
      | attributes | clothes,men |
      | attributes | women       |
    And I save product restrictions for cart rule rule_50_percent
    Then cart rule "rule_50_percent" should have the following product restriction rule groups:
      | groupReference | quantity | rules count |
      | group_nr_1     | 3        | 1           |
      | group_nr_2     | 2        | 2           |
    And the cart rule restriction group "group_nr_1" should have the following rules:
      | type       | references |
      | categories | home       |
    And the cart rule restriction group "group_nr_2" should have the following rules:
      | type       | references  |
      | attributes | clothes,men |
      | attributes | women       |
