Feature: Set cart rule product restrictions in BO
  PrestaShop allows BO users to add and remove product restrictions of cart rule,
  Product restrictions are a rulesets that defines what & how many products must be in a cart for cart rule to take effect.
  As a BO user I must be able to edit cart rules products restrictions

  Background:
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92
    And there is a currency named "chf" with iso code "CHF" and exchange rate of 1.25
    And currency "usd" is the default one
    And language "language1" with locale "en-US" exists
    And language with iso code "en" is the default one
    And category "home" in default language named "Home" exists
    And category "home" is the default one
    And I create cart rule "rule_free_shipping_1" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]       | free shipping 1      |
      | is_active         | true                 |

      | code              | rule_free_shipping_1 |
    And I create cart rule "rule_50_percent" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]                            | Half the price         |

    And I create cart rule "rule_70_percent" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]                            | Half the price         |

      | discount_application_type              | order_without_shipping |
    And cart rule "rule_free_shipping_1" should have no product restriction rules
    And I add product "product1" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | bottle of beer |
      | type        | virtual        |
    And I add product "product2" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | T-shirt nr.1 |
      | type        | standard     |
    And I add product "product3" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | Shirt - Dom & Jquery |
      | type        | standard             |

  Scenario: Restrict cart rule products
    When I add a restriction for cart rule rule_free_shipping_1, which requires at least 5 products in cart matching one of these rules:
      | type     | references        |
      | products | product1,product2 |
    And I save product restrictions for cart rule rule_free_shipping_1
#    When I restrict following cart rules for cart rule rule_free_shipping_1:
#      | rule_50_percent |
#    Then cart rule "rule_free_shipping_1" should have the following properties:
#      | restricted cart rules | rule_50_percent |
#    And cart rule "rule_50_percent" should have the following properties:
#      | restricted cart rules | rule_free_shipping_1 |
#    And cart rule "rule_70_percent" should have the following properties:
#      | restricted cart rules |  |
#    When I restrict following cart rules for cart rule rule_free_shipping_1:
#      | rule_50_percent |
#      | rule_70_percent |
#    Then cart rule "rule_free_shipping_1" should have the following properties:
#      | restricted cart rules | rule_50_percent,rule_70_percent |
#    And cart rule "rule_50_percent" should have the following properties:
#      | restricted cart rules | rule_free_shipping_1 |
#    And cart rule "rule_70_percent" should have the following properties:
#      | restricted cart rules | rule_free_shipping_1 |

#  @restore-cart-rules-before-scenario
#  Scenario: Provide non-existing ids for cart rule restriction
#    When I restrict cart rules for rule_free_shipping_1 providing non-existing cart rules
#    Then I should get cart rule error about "non-existing cart rule"
#    And cart rule "rule_free_shipping_1" should have the following properties:
#      | restricted cart rules |  |
#
#  @restore-cart-rules-before-scenario
#  Scenario: Restrict cart rule combinations providing the same cart rule that is being edited in the restricted cart rules list
#    Given cart rule "rule_70_percent" should have the following properties:
#      | restricted cart rules |  |
#    When I restrict following cart rules for cart rule rule_70_percent:
#      | rule_50_percent |
#      | rule_70_percent |
#    Then I should get cart rule error about "invalid cart rule restriction"
#    And cart rule "rule_70_percent" should have the following properties:
